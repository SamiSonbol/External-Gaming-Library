GUI with a search function and launch .exe function; written in SFML

This code is written with SFML and correctly creates a GUI with a list of games with a respective animated background. Moreover no Manual input is needed to detect or add any game, the code does it automatically for a "Games" folder found on the same Drive as the project .exe. Simply drag and drop a game into "Games" folder and optionally a .png spritesheet next to the game's .exe is enough for the code. PS: working on fixing high memory usage.
